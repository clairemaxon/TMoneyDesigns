# TMoneyDesigns

Sydney Thompson and Claire Maxon

	
T $ Designs, also known as T Money Designs, started many years ago when Claire’s grandfather, Tom Maxon, started making furniture for many of his family members. He would give his family many designs and took requests of designs that they wanted. The designs were outstanding, and soon he acquired many more clients.Today, Tom makes designs for different schools and charities.

Tom attempts to create anything at request. He has made things from tables to an urn carrier. He just recently has bought a new house and is using his ability of furniture making to repair and remodel all different kinds of things. For example, he made an entire fireplace with his bare hands.When we asked Tom what exactly he wanted us to make his website for, he told us he wanted people to see what he makes and inspire them to possibly do the same. He cares more about the exposure of the designs rather than the buying and selling of his designs. 

It took us a little while to complete our website. We started out on Codepen.io but soon realized that we could not make enough files to go to the extent that we needed to for the website. We switched to AWS Cloud 9 and our website started coming together. We struggled figuring out a few things at first, like getting pictures to center and home page ideas. 

We started our website out by creating the separate pages. We have a home page, an about me page, a my mission page, a my projects page, and a contact page. 

Home: 
We struggled for a while on what exactly to do with the home page. We then decided that simpler was better. We put the company name nice and big in the middle of the page with the links to the other pages directly underneath it.

About Me:
Here, we put some background information about Tom, his family, and where he 	lives. We also included a picture of him and his wife.

My Mission: 
We felt that it was necessary to put in our website why exactly Tom makes his      	furniture. We did exactly this with a picture of Tom making one of his designs underneath.

My Projects:
On this page, we put several pictures of Tom’s designs. These designs were a saddle holder, bunk beds, an urn carrier, pantry shelves, a fireplace, the laundry room, cornhole boards, a bench, and a craft table with shelves. 
Contact:
This page consists of Tom’s contact information. We put his phone number, his email, and his Instagram account. With the Instagram account name, we put a picture of the logo that you can click on and it takes you right to his account.

Color: 
We mainly stuck to the color scheme that our client requested. He requested the color gold, so we used the closest gold color we could find for the fonts of the navigation bar on all the pages other than the home page. On all the other text, we used the color white because it was the color that our client thought blended the best. 

Background:
Our background is a dark brown wood. We chose that background because the wood relates to building furniture, which is the main goal of this business. The dark color of the wood is very subtle and pleasing to the eye.

Font:
We wanted to use fonts that stood out but not in a huge way. The fonts we used were “Oswald” and “Roboto”. We used “Oswald” on the home page and on the navigation bar of all the other pages. We used “Roboto” for the texts of anything else on our website.
